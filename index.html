      <p>
        My name is wahyu, since junior high school I like the world of websites,
        when I first tried a website by creating a simple blog using a
        subdomain, until time went on I was increasingly interested in this
        field, in my opinion this is my fashion, I like and love the world of
        websites . after I graduated from vocational high school and because of
        the cost, I could not continue my favorite to a higher level, namely
        college to know more deeply, because this is my fashion, I am looking
        for another way, which is self-taught, learning from YouTube, searching
        Google if I am I have an error problem in my coding, and I also follow
        online learning on one of the websites, namely Dicoding, from there I
        get more and more knowledge about Web Programming, I am still a new kid
        yesterday in the world of Web Programming, but because I like this
        whenever I am I feel that programming knowledge has no limits as time
        goes by and I am still learning, honing my coding skills in programming
        languages ​​such as HTML, CSS, JavaScript, PHP, Mysql
